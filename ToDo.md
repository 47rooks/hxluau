# Stuff to do

   * finish API build out to include corroutines, debugger support
   * fix miscellaneous failures in a tests
   * build out macro support so any functions and types may be used in macros
   * add HL extern support
   * figure out proper build scripts for QoL
     * for security reasons I don't want to ship Luau binary so this has implications for devs
   * test, and if necessary fix, on Windows
   * rationalize the types and remove development cruft gather up to this point
